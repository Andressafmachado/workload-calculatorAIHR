# WorkloadCalculatorAIHR

to run:

The calculator was build in Angular to work with API available here: https://github.com/Andressafmachado/CoursesApiAIHR.

# Concerns
this project is a POC,

improvements before MVP:
- authentication (new feature to identify the user that create the entry),
- add id to elements to help in e2e,
- increase test coverage, 
- move the calculation to the backend

# config for running locally:
if necessary:
- enable "Allow invalid certificates for resources loaded from localhost." at chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost
- disable chrome extensions/developer mode
