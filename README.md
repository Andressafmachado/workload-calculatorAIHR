# WorkloadCalculatorAIHR

to run: 
- npm install
- ng serve

open: https://localhost:4200/

The calculator was build in Angular to work with API available here: https://github.com/Andressafmachado/CoursesApiAIHR.

# Concerns
this project is a POC,

improvements before MVP:
- authentication (new feature to identify the user that create the entry),
- add id to elements to help in e2e,
- increase test coverage, 
- move the calculation to the backend

(sometimes Chrome can give you a hard time opening localhost: disable chrome extensions/developer mode)
